# Dots And Boxes

Dots and Boxes is a pencil-and-paper game for two players. It was first published in the 19th century by Édouard Lucas, who called it la pipopipette. It has gone by many other names, including the game of dots, boxes, dot to dot grid, and pigs in a pen.
So I developed my terminal version in Python just clone the repository and enjoy the game with your friends.
    
## How to initialize the game ?

When you run the game you should have this menu:

Basically if you press "0" the game will Exit, if you press "1" you will have a second menu:

to make your table, for example the table will be 4*4 your input should be (4,4)
